Fan Zone:

- "Rotten Tomatoes" look (e.g. green and grey headings, anything else?)

Pages Hierarchy (create new menu for sidebar): 
- Home ('fanbase'?) - pics and overall #s of rotten and fresh ratings. Anything else?
	- child: Reviews - fill out form and your results are posted 
	- child: Related Page - movie/book
	- child: Related Page - director
	- child: Related Page - director's new books


Where are the Reviews Coming from?
- comments
- homework that can be collectively posted at once
- form that adds content to the website

- BuddyPress?? (activity streams - https://codex.buddypress.org/administrator-guide/activity-streams/ ) -> or perhaps buddy press formatted to look like Rotten Tomatoes forum??

there's also peep.so (which you must pay for anything more than the baseline - but which is quite nice-looking and a more straight-out-the-box solution) - this is more like a full-service social network, featuring chat etc.
-- and halo.social ...which is fairly mysterious

also "LearnPress"- WP learning management system plugin
also StudyPress (though LP has much more support)

POSSIBLE PLUGINS (there's a whole world of BuddyPress...)--
BuddyPress
BP First Letter Avatar
BP Forum Editor
BP Activity Plus - or better yet, rtMedia for WP, BP & bbPress -- for linking videos, articles, images... --- or, MediaPress
BP Docs -- adds collaborative Docs
BP messages spam blocker
BP - New UI
Voter Plugin -- so can say, "vote thumbs up for fresh or thumbs down for rotten" -- or, better yet, Like Button Voting and Rating -- or, BP Reactions (react to *activities* w/ faves, likes - to get feedback, perhaps, on what's working?)
Rendez Vous - "schedule appointments in your BuddyPress powered community"
iFlyChat -- omg!! - except the 'free' version only supports up to 10 people in the single single chatroom at once... (same with chatroll)
BP Group Documents
Wise Chat - basic chatroom! -- or Chat Lite

The idea here is the BuddyPress or peep.so community on a particular site is that otherwordly quid-enabling-haec! So that you can, say, have a "Tout Le Monde" world-within-the-world

Also ---- WRITESHARE! - supposedly better supports longer writing projs.
& OnePress Social Locker - good for marketing ('pay' w/ a  like to see content)
